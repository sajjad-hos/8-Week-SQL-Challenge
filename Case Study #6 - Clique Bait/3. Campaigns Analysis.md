## Case Study #6 - Clique Bait - 3. Campaigns Analysis | Questions | Solutions | Result

#### Q1: Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique `visit_id` record and has the following columns:
- `user_id`
- `visit_id`
- `visit_start_time`: the earliest `event_time` for each visit
- `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
- `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
- `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the `visit_start_time` falls between the `start_date` and `end_date`
- `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
- `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the `sequence_number`)

#### ðŸ§  My Approach & Solution:

- A CTE (campaign_summary) is created to aggregate visit-level data for each user_id and visit_id.
- The events table is joined with users, event_identifier, and page_hierarchy to get user info, event types, and product details.
- A left join is used with the campaign_identifier table to map visits to campaigns based on visit_start_time.
- Conditional aggregation calculates page views, cart adds, purchases, ad impressions, and ad clicks for each visit.
- STRING_AGG is used to create a comma-separated list of products added to the cart, ordered by sequence_number.

        STRING_AGG(
            CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN ph.page_name END, ', ' 
            ORDER BY e.sequence_number
        ) AS cart_products

    JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
    LEFT JOIN clique_bait.campaign_identifier c ON e.event_time BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date
    GROUP BY u.user_id, e.visit_id, c.campaign_name

- Each row represents one visit by a user.
- The page_views and cart_adds summarize activity during that visit.
- The purchase indicates if any purchase occurred.
- The campaign_name links the visit to a running marketing campaign, and impression or click shows ad interactions.
- The cart_products lists items added in order.

#### Q2: Use the subsequent dataset to generate at least 5 insights for the Clique Bait team - bonus: prepare a single A4 infographic that the team can use for their management reporting sessions, be sure to emphasise the most important points from your findings.

Some ideas you might want to investigate further include:
Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event
Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?
What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?
What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to eachother?

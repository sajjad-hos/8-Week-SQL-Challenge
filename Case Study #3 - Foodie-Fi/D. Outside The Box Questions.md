To calculate Foodie-Fiâ€™s rate of growth, we can track the customer growth rate over time, measuring how the number of active or paying customers changes from one period to the next.

````sql
WITH monthly_customers AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date) AS month_start,
        TO_CHAR(start_date, 'Mon YYYY') AS month_year,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS new_customers
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
    WHERE plan_id <> 4
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)

SELECT
    month_year, new_customers,
    LAG(new_customers) OVER (ORDER BY month_start) AS prev_month_customers,
    ROUND(100.0 * (new_customers - LAG(new_customers) OVER (ORDER BY month_start)) / LAG(new_customers) OVER (ORDER BY month_start), 1) || '%' AS customer_growth_rate
FROM monthly_customers
ORDER BY month_start;

#### Q2: What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess the performance of their overall business?
Key metrics I would recommend to Foodie-Fi management:
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): Measures predictable revenue growth and trends over time.
- Customer Growth / Active Users: Tracks how many new customers join and how many are actively using the service (DAU/MAU).
- Churn Rate: Percentage of customers cancelling subscriptions; helps identify retention issues.
- Trial-to-Paid Conversion Rate: Measures how effectively free trial users become paying customers.
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): Shows the total revenue a customer brings over their subscription, helping prioritize high-value customers.

#### Q3: What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
Key customer journeys to analyze for retention:
- Cancellations to understand why customers leave.
- Trial-to-paid conversion to see where users drop off before upgrading.
- Feature usage to identify which features drive engagement and retention.
- Engagement patterns to spot inactive users and triggers for churn.
- Support interactions to assess how support impacts customer loyalty.
  
#### Q4: If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
I would include the following questions in the survey:
- Q1. What are the main reasons youâ€™re cancelling your subscription? (Subscription costly / Found an alternative / Missing features / Other)
- Q2. Overall, how satisfied were you with your Foodie-Fi experience? (Very satisfied / Satisfied / Dissatisfied / Very dissatisfied)
- Q3. Which feature(s) did you feel were missing? (More cooking ideas / Better recommendations / Easier navigation / Other)
- Q4. Would you consider returning to Foodie-Fi in the future? (Definitely / Maybe / No)
- Q5. Do you have any additional feedback to help us improve? (Optional) (Please share any thoughts or suggestions: __)

#### Q5: What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?

Business levers to reduce churn:
- Act on feedback by addressing common issues from exit surveys. For example, price concerns can be addressed by offering discounts, extending trials, or adding benefits.
- Besides customer feedback in the exit survey, boost engagement by sending tips, reminders, or promotions and highlighting unused features to keep customers active.
- Also flexible plans & loyalty by offering tiered subscriptions and rewarding long-term customers.

Measuring effectiveness:
- Track churn rate over time.
- Monitor trial-to-paid conversions and plan changes.
- Measure customer satisfaction or NPS.
- Use A/B testing to confirm improvements work.

## ðŸ¥‘ Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi â€“ A. Customer Journey | Questions | Solutions | Result

#### Q. Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey. Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

#### ðŸ§  My Approach & Solution:

- I created a CTE named customerwithplans that selects only the relevant records and 8 sample customers by joining the subscriptions and plans tables.
- In the main query, I used STRING_AGG to concatenate each customerâ€™s plan names along with their start dates chronologically.
- I used GROUP BY to ensure that each customerâ€™s entire onboarding journey is presented in a single row.

````sql
WITH customerwithplans AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    p.plan_name,
    s.start_date
  FROM subscriptions s
  INNER JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  WHERE s.customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
)
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  STRING_AGG(plan_name || ' (' || start_date || ')', ' â†’ ' ORDER BY start_date) AS "onboarding journey"
FROM customerwithplans
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
  ````

#### Q2: What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value?
#### ðŸ§  My Approach & Solution:
````sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date) AS month_number,
  TO_CHAR(start_date, 'Month') AS month_name,
  COUNT(s.customer_id) AS trial_plan_subscriptions
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE s.plan_id = 0
GROUP BY month_number, month_name, DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date)
ORDER BY month_number;
  ````

#### ðŸ“Š Query Result & Insights:
| month_number | month_name | trial_plan_subscriptions |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 1            | January    | 88                       |

| basic monthly | 8               |

#### Q4: What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
#### ðŸ§  My Approach & Solution:
````sql

    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_churned,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions), 1) || '%' AS churn_percent
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 4;
  ````

#### ðŸ§  My Approach & Solution:
````sql
WITH ordered_subs AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id, plan_id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS subscription_number
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
)
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS churned_after_trial,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions),
        0) || '%' AS churn_percentage
FROM ordered_subs
WHERE plan_id = 4 AND subscription_number = 2;
  ````

| 92                  | 9%               |

- 92 customers churned immediately after their free trial, which is 9% of all customers.

#### Q6: What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
#### ðŸ§  My Approach & Solution:
````sql
WITH customer_next_plan AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        plan_id AS free_trial_plan,
        LEAD(plan_id) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS next_active_plan
    FROM subscriptions
)
SELECT 
    p.plan_name AS plan_after_trial,
    COUNT(*) AS total_customers_converted,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions), 1) || '%' AS percent_of_total_customers
FROM customer_next_plan cnp
LEFT JOIN plans p ON cnp.next_active_plan = p.plan_id
WHERE cnp.free_trial_plan = 0 AND cnp.next_active_plan IS NOT NULL

)
SELECT
    current_plan AS plan_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers_no_next,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions), 1) || '%' AS percent_of_all_customers

SELECT ROUND(AVG(a.annual_start_date - t.trial_start_date), 0) AS average_days_to_upgrade
FROM trial_subscriptions t
INNER JOIN annual_subscriptions a ON t.customer_id = a.customer_id;
  ````
#### ðŸ“Š Query Result & Insights:

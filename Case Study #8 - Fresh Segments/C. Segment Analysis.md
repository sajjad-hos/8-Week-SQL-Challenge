#### Q1: Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any `month_year`? Only use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding `month_year`
#### Q2: Which 5 interests had the lowest average `ranking` value?
#### ðŸ§  My Approach & Solution:

````sql
SELECT
  ima.interest_name,
  ROUND(AVG(ime.ranking), 1) AS avg_ranking
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics ime
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ima ON ime.interest_id::INT = ima.id
GROUP BY ima.interest_name
ORDER BY avg_ranking ASC
LIMIT 5;

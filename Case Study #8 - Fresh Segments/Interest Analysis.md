## Interest Analysis | Questions | Solutions | Results

#### Q1: Which interests have been present in all `month_year` dates in our dataset?
#### Q2: Using this same `total_months` measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?
#### Q3: If we were to remove all `interest_id` values which are lower than the `total_months` value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?
#### Q4: Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed `interest` example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.
#### Q5: After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?

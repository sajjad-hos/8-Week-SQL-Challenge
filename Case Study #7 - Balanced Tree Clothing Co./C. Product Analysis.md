#### Q1: What are the top 3 products by total revenue before discount?
#### üß† My Approach & Solution:

````sql
WITH product_revenue AS (
    SELECT 
        s.prod_id,
        pd.product_name,
        SUM(s.price * s.qty) AS total_revenue
    FROM balanced_tree.sales s
    INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details pd ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
    GROUP BY s.prod_id, pd.product_name
)
SELECT 
    prod_id,
    product_name,
    total_revenue
FROM product_revenue
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;
  ````

#### üìä Query Result & Insights:
| prod_id | product_name                 | total_revenue |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| 2a2353  | Blue Polo Shirt - Mens       | 217683        |
| 9ec847  | Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens | 209304        |

#### Q2: What is the total quantity, revenue, and discount for each segment?  
#### üß† My Approach & Solution:
- Joined sales with product_details to get the segment for each product, and then summed up the quantity sold, total revenue, and discount. Finally, grouped by segment_id and segment_name to get one row per segment.

````sql
SELECT 
  pd.segment_id,
  pd.segment_name AS segment, 
  SUM(s.qty) AS total_quantity,
  SUM(s.qty * s.price) AS total_revenue,
  SUM((s.qty * s.price) * s.discount / 100) AS total_discount
FROM balanced_tree.sales s
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details pd ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY pd.segment_id, pd.segment_name;
  ````

#### üìä Query Result & Insights:
| segment_id | segment | total_quantity | total_revenue | total_discount |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 4          | Jacket  | 11385          | 366983        | 42451          |
| 6          | Socks   | 11217          | 307977        | 35280          |
| 5          | Shirt   | 11265          | 406143        | 48082          |
| 3          | Jeans   | 11349          | 208350        | 23673          |

- For the segment Jacket, the total units sold were 11385 units, the total revenue generated $366983 with $42451 discount.
- For the segment Socks, the total units sold were 11217 units, the total revenue generated $307977 with $35280 discount.
- For the segment Shirt, the total units sold were 11265 units, the total revenue generated $406143 with $48082 discount.
- For the segment Jeans, the total units sold were 11349 units, the total revenue generated $208350 with $23673 discount.

#### Q3: What is the top selling product for each segment?  
#### üß† My Approach & Solution:
- I created CTE product_totals and used a ranking function (like RANK()) inside the CTE to rank products by quantity per segment.
- In the main query, I selected only products with rank = 1 to get the top-selling product(s) for each segment.

````sql
WITH product_totals AS (
    SELECT 
        pd.segment_name,
        pd.product_name,
        SUM(s.qty) AS total_quantity,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY pd.segment_name ORDER BY SUM(s.qty) DESC) AS rank_in_segment
    FROM balanced_tree.sales s
    INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details pd ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
    GROUP BY pd.segment_name, pd.product_name
)
SELECT 
    segment_name AS segment,
    product_name AS top_selling_product,
    total_quantity
FROM product_totals
WHERE rank_in_segment = 1;
  ````

#### üìä Query Result & Insights:
| segment | top_selling_product           | total_quantity |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Jacket  | Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens  | 3876           |
| Jeans   | Navy Oversized Jeans - Womens | 3856           |

| Socks   | Navy Solid Socks - Mens       | 3792           |

#### Q9: What is the total transaction ‚Äúpenetration‚Äù for each product?

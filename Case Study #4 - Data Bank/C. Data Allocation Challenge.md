## Case Study #4 - C. Data Allocation Challenge | Solutions | Result

To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

- Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month
- Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
- Option 3: data is updated real-time

For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

- running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction
- customer balance at the end of each month
- minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required for each option on a monthly basis?

#### Q1: Running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction.

#### ðŸ§  My Approach & Solution:
- Converted all transaction amounts into signed amounts (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals/purchases).
- Used a window function to compute a running sum per customer, ordered by date.

````sql
WITH signed_transactions AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        txn_date,
        txn_type,
        txn_amount,
        CASE 
            WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount
            WHEN txn_type IN ('withdrawal','purchase') THEN -txn_amount
            ELSE 0
        END AS signed_amount
    FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    txn_date,
    txn_type,
    txn_amount,
    SUM(signed_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY txn_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS running_balance
FROM signed_transactions
ORDER BY customer_id, txn_date;
  ````

#### ðŸ“Š Query Result & Insights:
The result is displayed here only for the first five customers, as the entire result set is large.

#### Q2: Customer balance at the end of each month.
#### ðŸ§  My Approach & Solution:
- Calculated monthly closing balance per customer (deposits positive, withdrawals/purchases negative).
- Grouped by customer and month and display month start, month name, and balance in order.

````sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', txn_date)::date AS month_start,
    TO_CHAR(txn_date, 'Month') AS month_name,
    SUM(CASE 
            WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount
            WHEN txn_type IN ('withdrawal','purchase') THEN -txn_amount
            ELSE 0
        END) AS closing_balance
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
GROUP BY customer_id, month_start, month_name
ORDER BY customer_id, month_start;

#### Q3: Minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer.
#### ðŸ§  My Approach & Solution:
- Calculated running balance using a window function (SUM() OVER) with PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date.
- Then, I calculated the minimum, maximum, and average balance for each customer.

````sql
WITH running_balance AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        txn_date,
        txn_type,
        txn_amount,
        SUM(CASE 
                WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount
                WHEN txn_type IN ('withdrawal','purchase') THEN -txn_amount
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
    FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
)
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    MIN(running_balance) AS min_running_balance,
    MAX(running_balance) AS max_running_balance,
    ROUND(AVG(running_balance),1) AS avg_running_balance
FROM running_balance
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
  ````

| 2           | 549                 | 610                 | 579.5               |

Now, for each option, the running balance, month-end balance, and the minimum, average, and maximum balances will be applied to determine the total amount of data required on a monthly basis.

           CASE 
               WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount

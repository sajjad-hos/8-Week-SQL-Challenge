## 📅 8-Week-SQL-Challenge
This repository contains my solutions to the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com) by **Data With Danny**.
Each case study helped me practice solving real business problems using SQL. It covers everything from basic queries to advanced topics like joins, CTEs, and window functions.
I completed all solutions using **PostgreSQL v17**. This journey has been a fantastic learning experience, helping me grow not only my SQL skills but also my ability to think critically and analytically like a data professional.
